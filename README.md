## Issues

| Date       | Issue |
| -- | -- |
| 12/03/2020 | Data for 12/03/2020 appears to be wrong for some European countries as no new cases has been reported in the data contrary to figures reported in other sources.|
| 23/03/2020 | Johns Hopkins University has stopped publishing recovered cases data |
